*Name:* dShaltie Architecture

*Type:* overview

*Author:* https://github.com/KirillPamPam

== Summary

There is a high level overview of dShaltie architecture with its modules and what they are responsible for

== Detailed design

image::balancer.png[alt="",width=90%,align="center"]

dShaltie is smart and fault-tolerant RPC proxy whose main goal is to select the best upstream based on various characteristics (such as latency, error rate, lag, budgets, etc.) that can execute a client's request.

=== Modules

1. Request module
- receive clients requests and prepare them for further processing
- it can work with any of these protocols: *JSON-RPC*, *REST*, *Websocket*, *GRPC*
- parse requests into the internal representation and pass them to the Execution Flow module
- return responses to the clients
- stream http responses

2. Auth module

- auth user requests using a conceptions of keys like in drpc
- these keys can have different additional properties that should be applied later during request processing

3. Execution Flow module
- select a project and its upstreams for further processing
- the single entry point for all requests
- use the Balancing module to select an upstream that can execute a request and pass it
- use the Hooks module for the response post-processing
- wait for all responses and return them to the request module and then to the clients

4. Balancing module
- select upstreams based on their characteristics
- check upstreams state data like their lag
- use the Rating module to filter upstreams based on their performance data like latency, error rate, etc.

5. Rating module
- calculate the upstream rating based on performance data

6. Hooks module
- cache responses to the following storages - *Memory*, *Redis*, *PostgreSQL*, *Mongo*
- write stats to Prometheus or dRPC via

7. Upstream module
- read the config file and create upstreams with all their elements
- create upstream connectors (*JSON-RPC*, *REST*, *Websocket*, *GRPC*)
- create upstream heads (*RpcHead*, *WsHead*) and receive them
- there is chain specific logic for different networks (*JSON-RPC*, *Solana*, *Cosmos*, *Near*, *Polkadot*, etc.)
- track upstream and chain state via a common pipeline

== Unresolved questions

Nothing.
